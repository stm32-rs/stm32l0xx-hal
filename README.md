[_stm32l0xx-hal_](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32l0xx-hal) is a Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL) for the STMicro STM32L0xx family of microcontrollers.

This crate relies on Adam Greig's [stm32l0](https://crates.io/crates/stm32l0)
crate to provide appropriate register definitions and implements a partial set
of the [embedded-hal](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) traits.

Based on the [stm32l1xx-hal](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32l1xx-hal) crate
by Vitaly Domnikov and the [stm32f4xx-hal](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f4xx-hal)
crate by Daniel Egger.


# Usage

Add the [`stm32l0xx-hal` crate](https://crates.io/crates/stm32l0xx-hal) to your
dependencies in `Cargo.toml` and make sure to pick the appropriate `mcu-*`
Cargo feature to enjoy the full feature set for your MCU (see next section
"Supported Configurations" for more details).

For example, when using the STM32L071KBTx MCU:

```toml
[dependencies]
stm32l0xx-hal = { version = "0.10.0", features = ["mcu-STM32L071KBTx", "rt"] }
```


# Supported Configurations

The STM32L0 family consists of different subfamilies with different peripherals
and I/O configurations. Superficially, the family can be grouped into the
groups `stm32l0x1`, `stm32l0x2` and `stm32l0x3`. However, some aspects like
alternate function mappings for I/O pins do not follow these groups.

In order for the HAL to properly support all those MCUs, we generate some
peripheral mappings and corresponding Cargo features using
[cube-parse](https://github.com/stm32-rs/cube-parse/).

## MCU Features (`mcu-*`)

The easiest way for you to get started, is to use your appropriate `mcu-*`
feature. For example, when using the STM32L071KBTx MCU, you just set the
`mcu-STM32L071KBTx` feature in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
stm32l0xx-hal = { version = "0.10.0", features = ["mcu-STM32L071KBTx", "rt"] }
```

If you take a look at the [`Cargo.toml`
file](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32l0xx-hal/blob/master/Cargo.toml), you
can see that `mcu-STM32L071KBTx` is just an alias for `["io-STM32L071",
"eeprom-6144", "flash-128", "ram-20"]`.

## I/O Features (`io-*`)

The `io-*` features are based on the GPIO peripheral version. This determines
the pin function mapping of the MCU. The features seem to correspond to the
product categories.

Right now, the following features are supported:

- `io-STM32L021` (Product category 1)
- `io-STM32L031` (Product category 2)
- `io-STM32L051` (Product category 3)
- `io-STM32L071` (Product category 5)

The product categories should be listed in your MCU family datasheet. The name
of the `io-*` feature itself is derived from the internal name used in the
STM32CubeMX database. It does not necessarily match the name of the MCU,
for example the `STM32L062K8Tx` uses the GPIO peripheral version named
`io-STM32L051`.

## Memory Layout: Flash (`flash-*`) and RAM (`ram-*`)

Flash and RAM sizes are automatically configured by using the appropriate
`mcu-*` Cargo feature, as described further up.

If you have an MCU that does not yet have a corresponding `mcu-*` feature, or
if the default configuration is incorrect, you can override the `memory.x` of
`stm32l0xx-hal` by providing your own:

In your crate root, add a file called `memory.x` with the correct
configuration. For example:

```
MEMORY
{
  FLASH : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 64K
  RAM : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 8K
}
```

Add a `build.rs` file with the following content:

```rust
use std::env;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn main() {
    // Put the linker script somewhere the linker can find it
    let out = &PathBuf::from(env::var_os("OUT_DIR").unwrap());
    File::create(out.join("memory.x"))
        .unwrap()
        .write_all(include_bytes!("memory.x"))
        .unwrap();
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-search={}", out.display());

    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=build.rs");
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=memory.x");
}
```

And finally add the `disable-linker-script` feature to your `stm32l0xx-hal` dependency:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
stm32l0xx-hal = { version = "0.10.0", features = ["mcu-STM32L071K8Ux", "disable-linker-script"] }
```

# Other Cargo Features

- `rtc`: Enable the RTC API based on [rtcc](https://docs.rs/rtcc/). Enabled by default.

# Toolchain Setup

In order to use this HAL, you need the following Setup:

1. Install Rustup

    See [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) for details. You may als be able to
    install Rustup directly through your distro.

2. Install the `arm-none-eabi` compiler toolchain

	https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads

    If you cannot install the toolchain directly through your OS / distro, we
    recommend installing the precompiled binaries to '/usr/local/opt'.  Add the
    bin folders (/bin & /arm-none-eabi/bin) to your environments variable 'PATH'.

3. Install the `thumbv6m-none-eabi` target for Rust

    Simply run `rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi`

4. Install [probe-run](https://crates.io/crates/probe-run) to run examples.

    ```bash
    cargo install probe-run
    ```

using Rust, check out the [Embedded Rust
Book](https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/).


# Build Examples

You can build examples through Cargo:

    $ cargo build --release --examples --features stm32l0x1,rt

Note that not all examples are compatible with all MCUs. You might need to peek
into the example source code.

# Run Examples

This crate uses [probe-run](https://crates.io/crates/probe-run) to run examples on target hardware. 

To run the `blinky` example on an STM32L053 Nucleo:

```bash
cargo run --example blinky --features mcu-STM32L053R8Tx -- --chip STM32L053R8Tx
```

# Flashing Using Helper Scripts

The following instructions outline how-to on flashing the 'serial' example
code. This can be extended to any other example code.

## Flashing with ST-Flash:

1. Flash the microcontroller using the flash script
    ``` 
    $ ./flash.sh target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/examples/serial
    ```

## Flashing with OpenOCD

1. Flash the microcontroller using the openocd flash script
    ``` 
    $ ./openocd_flash.sh target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/examples/serial
    ```
