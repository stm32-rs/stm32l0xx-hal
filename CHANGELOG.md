## [v0.8.1] - 2021-12-09

### Additions

- Unify RCC enable / reset ([#196])

### Breaking Changes

- Setup hsi16diven when running Rcc::freeze ([#197])

### Non-Breaking Changes

- Fix clippy lints ([#200])

### Documentation

- Fix Cargo features used by docs.rs ([#203])


## [v0.8.0] - 2021-11-04

### Additions

- Add `Timer::new` to create timer without starting. ([#152])
- Add (untested) example `temperature` ([#161]) which uses `adc` to read the
  internal temperature and also an externally connected TMP36 analog sensor.
- Add `Pwm::set_frequency` to allow dynamically changing the underlying PWM timer's
  frequency. This was previously impossible without resorting to `unsafe` because the
  channels where moved out of the timer struct and Rust's ownership rules forbade us
  to borrow the timer to call `set_frequency`. ([#174])
- Add Cargo features for flash and RAM sizes allowing to pass the correct sizes to
  the linker instead of having a default for the whole sub-family. ([#173])

### Breaking Changes

- Migrate from custom `Hertz` implementation to [`embedded-time`](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-time) ([#183])
- Add `enable` to `GeneralPurposeTimer`
- `Instance::clock_frequency` is now an associated function and doesn't take `&self` anymore.
- Build script requires that exactly one `flash-*` and one `ram-*` feature is enabled. They are
  enabled automatically when using an `mcu-*` feature, but if you manually selected the other features
  before this will break the build because of the missing features.
- The `rtc::RTC` struct has been renamed to `rtc::Rtc` and includes a big
  refactoring and a few API changes. It now implements the traits from the
  [rtcc crate](https://docs.rs/rtcc/) and uses date/time types from Chrono.
- When downgrading GPIO pins, not only the pin number but also the port
  identifier is erased. To update your code, replace
  `PA`/`PB`/`PC`/`PD`/`PE`/`PH` with `Pin`. ([#190])

### Non-Breaking Changes

- The crate now has an optional `rtc` feature (enabled by default). The `rtc`
  module is only available if that feature is enabled. Enabling the feature
  also pulls in the `rtcc` and `chrono` dependencies, in oder to support a
  richer calendar / clock API.

### Fixes

- Fixed potential race condition when flushing the tx serial buffer.
- Fixed RTC year handling. Previously, the implementation incorrectly assumed
  that the BCD year 00 corresponds to 1970, but this results in a wrong leap
  year calculation. The correct time base is the year 2000.


## [v0.7.0] - 2021-03-10

### Additions

- Timers: Add support for TIM6 ([#101])
- Timers: Implement `LinkedTimer` ([#115]). It is initialized with two hardware
  timers (either TIM2/TIM3 or TIM21/TIM22). The two timers are configured in
  master/slave mode so that an overflow of the master timer triggers an update
  on the slave timer. This way, two 16 bit timers can be combined to a single
  32 bit timer.  (The STM32L0 does not have 32 bit timers.)
- Remove config tests that prevented stm32l0x1 devices from using ADC with DMA ([#124])
- Add `enable_lse` method to RCC structure that configures LSE ([#130])
- Expose factory calibration data ([#121])
- Prelude: add `Serial1Ext` ([#133])
- Flash: support stm32l0x3 ([#134])
- Add Cargo features for EEPROM size, generated with cube-parse ([#137])
- Flash: Support writing single bytes to EEPROM ([#140])
- Add MCO support ([#143])
- Timers: Add QEI support for LPTIM ([#144])
- Timers: Add encoder input support for TIM2 and TIM21 ([#145])
- Timers: Adds support for LSE clocking to LPUART ([#131])
- SPI: Add DMA support ([#148])

### Breaking Changes

### Non-Breaking Changes

- Improvements to polling iÂ²c driver ([#102])
- Enforce rustfmt ([#107])
- Simplify `flash.c` ([#136])

### Fixes

- I2C: Before starting new transaction ensure that both TX and RX buffers are empty ([#98])
- Detect rollover using positions rather than DMA flags ([#127]). This fixes a
  faulty DMA buffer overflow in `adc_trig` example ([#104]).
- Maximum frequency for stm32l0 increased to 32MHz ([#129])
- GPIO: Fix `Pin::into_pull_down_input` ([#142])

### Documentation

- Document MSIRange enum variants ([#99])
- Port examples to RTFM/RTIC 0.5 ([#100], [#116])
- Improve README ([#119])
